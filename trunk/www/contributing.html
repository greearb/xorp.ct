<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p> XORP is an open source project: we <u>want</u> people to
contribute.  We'd like to build a community of users and a community
of developers.  Ultimately the project to become self-sustaining.  At
the present time, the project is bootstrapping: even attaining basic
router functionality requires a large amount of effort.  We currently
lack the functionality to attract users, but perhaps offers enough
promise to attract a few bold developers and documenters.  As the
basic functionality pads out, hopefully we'll attract more users and
garner more contributions.

<p>Listed below are a few areas where contributions could usefully be
made now.  If you are interested in these, have additional
suggestions, or are generally interested in getting involved, we'd
like to hear from you. It could be that someone is already working
on some of the items, so always send an email before starting the work.

<h2>General</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Feedback on the ease of getting started.</b>
    <p>Any contributions that may help others get started.
</ul>

<h2>Code contributions</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Code reviews.</b>
  <p> Pick a module.  Look it over.  Read the source.  Read the
      kdoc documentation (see ${XORP}/docs/kdoc).  Compare and
      contrast the design documents (under ${XORP}/docs) with the
      code.  Code reviews are most welcome. </p>

  <li><b>Scripting language support.</b>

  <p>It would be great to be able to call XORP code from other
     languages.  One way this might be done for maximal benefit
     and moderate effort would to use <a
     href="http://swig.sourceforge.net">SWIG</a>.  SWIG generates
     wrappers for C and C++ code allowing it to be called from a
     wide range of scripting languages.</p>

  <li><b>A <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/">Click</a>
      based forwarding engine abstraction (FEA).</b>
	  <p>It's been a goal from day one to support Click, but as
	  we've gone forward we've not managed to keep the Click
	  support in the FEA up to date.  This is a crying shame and
	  needs to be rectified. </p>

  <li><b>Adding multicast support to
    <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/">Click</a>.</b>
    <p>This is a Click-oriented item, but would benefit XORP
	and potentially benefit other multicast projects. </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Design and development of a multicast testing framework.</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>MIB implementation.</b>
    <p>We have the SNMP base support, but currently there are very few MIBs
     that are implemented. Pick a protocol, and add the MIB support for it.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Wireless access router.</b>
    <p>For example, an integration of dhcpd, firewall, web interface, and an
     AAA server into the XORP framework.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Web interface for XORP.</b>
    <p>People like Web interfaces. Also, they can be used for cool demos.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Add VLAN support.</b>
    <p>Systems like <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>
       already do have support for VLAN (see <a
       href="http://people.freebsd.org/~arved/vlan/vlan_en.html">FreeBSD VLAN 
       mini HowTo</a>). Configuring VLANs before running XORP is not an
       elegant solution. A better solution is to integrate the VLAN
       configuration in XORP.</p>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b> </b>
  </li>
</ul>
-->

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Developer API documentation reviews and feedback.</b>

	<p>kdoc comments are embedded in the C++ header files and
	turned into html documentation using kdoc.  This documentation
	is always a work-in-progress and always has room for improvement.
	Feedback and patches are welcome. </p>

	<li><b>Design documentation.</b>
	<p> Design documents are available online
        <a href="design_docs.html">here</a> and are accessible in the
	source tree under <tt>${XORP}/docs</tt>.  If you have the time please
	read them over, and feel free to make suggestions, point out areas of
	ambiguity, and inconsistencies, etc. </p>
  </li>

    <li><b>Web site design.</b>
	<p>As with everything in this project, the web pages are
	   available via CVS and CVSWeb.  The web site tends to
	   undergo &quot;development&quot; in the run up to releases
	   and remain relatively static the rest of the time. </p>

 </ul>

<h2>Donations</h2>

We're amenable to donations.  Please mail mjh&#64;icir&#46;org if 
you are interested in making a donation.

<ul>
  <li><b>Hardware/Software.</b>

  <p>Anything from spare machines, network cards, etc, up to 64bit
  workstations.  Preferably equipment with a moderate size user
  base and publicly available documentation since we have very
  limited developer resources.  At some point in the future, we'd
  like to be in a position to correlate hardware donations to
  external project contributors. </p>

  <li> <b>Financial.</b> 

  <p> Money pays the rent, pays interns,
      and potentially allows us to employ more people full time. </p>

</ul>
