------------------------------ TODO -----------------------------

1) The script test_peering1.sh does not actually check that the bgp
process has terminated. When the test was written calling the
terminate/shutdown XRL used to cause the bgp process to core dump.

2) More decision table tests involving MEDs in test_routing2.sh, to
test that deleting and replacing routes involving meds also work
correctly.

3) Send a message that exceeds the 4K limit.

4) Send update messages with multiprotocol nlri but don't include
mandatory attributes. Tests already exist for IPv4 unicast.

5) Test that we don't send multiprotocol nlri to peers with whom we
didn't negotiate such an option.

------------------------------ DONE -----------------------------
