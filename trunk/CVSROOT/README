This is README file for the XORP CVS repository configuration.

Introduction
============
The configuration files and scripts are based on the FreeBSD
CVSROOT-src CVS configuration. The major differences are:

 * The configuration and the scripts are modified to work with
   a generic CVS installation (currently, 1.12.9) rather than
   the FreeBSD-specific version.

 * The format of the email message has changed to resemble the
   original format.

To reconfigure the CVS repository, you need to do the following:
 1. cvs -d <CVS_root_directory> co CVSROOT
 2. Edit the configuration files
 3. CVS commit

Note that the access to the CVS configuration repository is limited
only to the CVS repository administrators (see file "CVSROOT/avail").

If you make a mistake and as a result of that you cannot commit to
the CVS repository, do not panic. Just login to the CVS server,
and edit by hand the particular file.
For example, if file "CVSROOT/avail" got corrupted, then do the following:
 1. ssh xorpc.icir.org
 2. cd /usr/local/share/doc/apache/cvs/CVSROOT
 3. Edit file "avail" and fix the problem.

After the edit you can cvs commit as usual. Note that a cvs commit
to any of the files in the CVSROOT directory automatically rebuilds the
administrative file database. After the rebuild any files such as
"CVSROOT/avail" in the above example ill be overwritten with their most
recent checked-in version.


Configuration
=============

 * Source code modification access control.
   The access control rules are configured in file "CVSROOT/avail".
   For example, the set of users who can change the CVS configuration
   is specified in group "cvs_managers".
   Some of the rules use the following files:
    - "CVSROOT/access.core" contains the list of core developers who
      can modify any of the XORP code (including documentation).
    - "CVSROOT/access.doc" contains the list of documentation commiters
      who can modify only the XORP documentation.

 * Configuration for checking approvals.
   If the source code has been tagged as a branch, then committing to
   a branch for a XORP release should be pre-approved. The
   set of approvers for each branch/tag is configured in
   file "CVSROOT/approvers".

 * Local configuration for the CVSROOT perl scripts.
   The perl scripts inside the CVSROOT directory have default
   configuration specified in file "CVSROOT/cfg.pm".
   The local configuration that overwrites the default configuration
   is specified in file "CVSROOT/cfg_local.pm".
   For example, to enforce checking for the CVSHeader,
   then variable CHECK_HEADERS should be set to 1.

 * Adding new files to the CVS configuration repository.
   If a new file is added to the CVS configuration repository,
   it should be listed in file "CVSROOT/checkoutlist", unless it
   is one of the special CVS files.

 * CVS-specific configuration.
   The CVS-specific configuration is specified inside file "CVSROOT/config".

 * Ignoring files during "cvs update".
   File "CVSROOT/cvsignore" can be used to specify the default set
   of files that are to be ignored during "cvs update".

 * Excluding files for header checking.
   If the CVS tag header checking is enabled (e.g., if variable
   CHECK_HEADERS is set to 1 inside file "CVSROOT/cfg_local.pm",
   then file "CVSROOT/exclude" can be used to specify the set
   of files that should be excluded from such check.

 * Configuring the template that is invoked on commit and import.
   The template that is invoked by the editor when the user tries
   to commit changes or import new files is specified in file
   "CVSROOT/rcstemplate". Note that any changes to this file should
   by synchronized with the definition of variable "TEMPLATE_HEADERS"
   inside file "CVSROOT/cfg_local.pm".

 * Restricting tagging the source code.
   Some tag names are reserved for specific purposes.
   For example, tag names starting with prefix RELEASE_* are reserved
   for software releases. Tagging the source code with such tag names
   is restricted only to the release managers. The access control is
   configured inside file "CVSROOT/tagcheck".
