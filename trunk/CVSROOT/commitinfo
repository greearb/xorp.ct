#
# The "commitinfo" file is used to control pre-commit checks.
# The filter on the right is invoked with the repository and a list
# of files to check.  A non-zero exit of the filter program will
# cause the commit to be aborted.
#
# The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being committed to, relative
# to the $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder
# of the line is the name of the filter to run.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in this
# file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
#
#
#ALL			$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitcheck
#DEFAULT		$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commit_prep -r %r/%p %{s}
ALL		$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitcheck %{r}/%{p} %{s}
