		XORP: eXtensible Open Router Platform



1. Overview
===========

XORP is an open networking platform that supports OSPF, RIP, BGP,
OLSR, VRRP, PIM, IGMP (Multicast) and other routing protocols.  Most protocols
support IPv4 and IPv6 where applicable.  It is known to work on various
Linux distributions and flavors of BSD.  It does not support MS Windows.

XORP started life as a project at the ICSI Center for Open Networking (ICON)
at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California,
USA, and spent some time with the team at XORP, Inc.  It is now maintained
and improved on a volunteer basis by a core of long-term XORP developers
and some newer contributors.

XORP's primary goal is to be an open platform for networking protocol
implementations and an alternative to proprietary and closed networking
products in the marketplace today.

XORP design philosophy is:
  * modularity
  * extensibility
  * performance
  * robustness
This is achieved by carefully separating functionalities into
independent modules, and by providing an API for each module.

XORP divides into two subsystems. The higher-level ("user-level")
subsystem consists of the routing protocols. The lower-level ("kernel")
manages the forwarding path, and provides APIs for the higher-level to
access.

User-level XORP uses multi-process architecture with one process per
routing protocol, and a novel inter-process communication mechanism
called XRL (XORP Resource Locator).

The lower-level subsystem can use traditional UNIX kernel forwarding, or
Click modular router. The modularity and independency of the lower-level
from the user-level subsystem allows for its easily replacement with
other solutions including high-end hardware-based forwarding engines.

For more information about XORP high-level design see the following
paper available from http://www.xorp.org/ :

For description of the changes in each release, see ${XORP}/RELEASE_NOTES.


3. Compilation, configuration and startup
=========================================

To compile XORP, you must have a recent version of scons and g++
compiler toolset installed.

cd xorp

scons

scons install

For help on scons and available compile options:
scons --help

You may also wish to try this script to create a tar.gz install package:
./lf_pkg.bash

In general, configuration and startup of the various XORP processes are
normally meant to happen via the router manager (rtrmgr), so please
refer first to the XORP online documentation linked from:
http://www.xorp.org


4. Code structure and documentation
===================================

The content of some important directories is listed below:

  * xorp/bgp : BGP implementation.

  * xorp/cli : CLI (Command-Line Interface) library.
    It is used by the Router Manager (rtrmgr), and by some of the
    multicast code (the multicast-specific part of fea, mld6igmp, pim).

  * docs : XORP user documentation.  Note that much of this is
    now on the wiki linked from www.xorp.org.  The latex based documentation
    is deprecated.

  * xorp/etc : Various XORP-related files (e.g., configuration, templates).

  * xorp/fea : Forwarding Engine Abstraction.
    The FEA implements the interface between XORP and the underlying
    forwarding engine (e.g., the UNIX kernel). It is used both for
    unicast and multicast. Note that the multicast-specific
    documentation is in ${XORP}/docs/mfea.

  * xorp/fib2mrib : Forwarding Information Base to the Multicast Routing
    Information Base route propagator.
    It uses the FEA to obtain the FIB information from the underlying
    system, and propagates it to the MRIB, so it can be used by
    multicast routing protocols such as PIM-SM. Typically, it is needed
    only if the unicast routing protocols run within XORP do not inject
    routes in the MRIB.

  * xorp/libcomm : Communication socket library.

  * xorp/libfeaclient : Library that is useful to clients of the FEA.

  * xorp/libproto : Abstract protocol library.
    Used by the following modules/directories: cli, fea, mld6igmp, ospf,
    pim.

  * xorp/libxipc : XRL (XORP Resource Locator) library and XRL-related
    programs.

  * xorp/libxorp : XORP library that contains various basic
    functionalities such as IP addresses, IP subnets, etc.

  * xorp/mld6igmp : Multicast Listen Discovery/Internet Group Management
    Protocol (MLD/IGMP) implementation.

  * xorp/mrt : Various multicast-related code.
    Used by the following modules/directories: fea, mld6igmp, pim.

  * xorp/ospf : Open Shortest Path First implementation.

  * xorp/policy : Policy-related library.

  * xorp/pim : Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
    implementation.

  * xorp/rib : Routing Information Base.
    It is used to store the routing information from various protocols.

  * xorp/rip: Routing Information Protocol implementation.

  * xorp/rtrmgr : Router Manager.
    It is used to manage and configure all XORP components.

  * xorp/static_routes : Static routes management.
    It is used to configure static routes.

  * xorp/vrrp : Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol implementation.

  * xorp/xrl : XRL (XORP Resource Locator) interface.

The directories listed below contain third-party contributed code which
is distributed with each XORP source release:

  * xorp/contrib : various contributed code.

    * olsr : RFC 3626 Optimized Link State Routing implementation.
      Generously funded by CenGen, Inc.  (Does not compile in 1.7,
      but will work in 1.8)

    * mld6igmp_lite : Implementation of the Lightweight IGMPv3/MLDv2
      protocols:
      - draft-ietf-mboned-lightweight-igmpv3-mldv2-02.txt

The directories listed below contain various information that are of
limited interest, or are not relevant to the current release:

  * devnotes : various notes for the XORP core members.
