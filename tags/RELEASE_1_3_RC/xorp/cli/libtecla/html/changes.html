In the following log, modification dates are listed using the European
convention in which the day comes before the month (ie. DD/MM/YYYY).
The most recent modifications are listed first.

10/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c
             If the TIOCGWINSZ ioctl doesn't work, as is the case when
             running in an emacs shell, leave the size unchanged, rather
             than returning a fatal error.

07/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           configure.in configure
             Now that the configure version of CFLAGS is included in
             the makefile, I noticed that the optimization flags -g
             and -O2 had been added. It turns out that if CFLAGS isn't
             already set, the autoconf AC_PROG_CC macro initializes it
             with these two optimization flags. Since this would break
             backwards compatibility in embedded distributions that
             already use the OPT= makefile argument, and because
             turning debugging on needlessly bloats the library, I now
             make sure that CFLAGS is set before calling this macro.

07/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           enhance.c
             Use argv[0] in error reports instead of using a
             hardcoded macro.

07/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c
             The cut buffer wasn't being cleared after being
             used as a work buffer by gl_load_history().

06/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           configure.in configure
             I removed my now redundant definition of SUN_TPUTS from
             CFLAGS. I also added "-I/usr/include" to CFLAGS under
             Solaris to prevent gcc from seeing conflicting versions
             of system header files in /usr/local/include.

06/12/2001 Markus Gyger (logged here by mcs)
           Lots of files.
             Lots of corrections to misspellings and typos in the
             comments.
           getline.c
             Markus reverted a supposed fix that I added a day or two
             ago. I had incorrectly thought that in Solaris 8, Sun had
             finally brought their declaration of the callback
             function of tputs() into line with other systems, but it
             turned out that gcc was pulling in a GNU version of
             term.h from /usr/local/include, and this was what
             confused me.

05/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           Makefile.in
             I added @CFLAGS@ to the CFLAGS assignment, so that
             if CFLAGS is set as an environment variable when
             configure is run, the corresponding make variable
             includes its values in the output makefile.

05/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c libtecla.h libtecla.map man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_last_signal.3
             I added a function that programs can use to find out
             which signal caused gl_get_line() to return EINTR.

05/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c
             When the newline action was triggered by a printable
             character, it failed to display that character. It now
             does. Also, extra control codes that I had added, to
             clear to the end of the display after the carriage return,
             but before displaying the prompt, were confusing expect
             scripts, so I have removed them. This step is now done
             instead in gl_redisplay() after displaying the full input
             line.

05/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             A user convinced me that continuing to invoke meta
             keybindings for meta characters that are printable is a
             bad idea, as is allowing users to ask to have setlocale()
             called behind the application's back. I have thus changed
             this. The setlocale configuration option has gone, and
             gl_get_line() is now completely 8-bit clean, by default.
             This means that if a meta character is printable, it is
             treated as a literal character, rather than a potential
             M-c binding.  Meta bindings can still be invoked via
             their Esc-c equivalents, and indeed most terminal
             emulators either output such escape pairs by default when
             the meta character is pressed, or can be configured to do
             so. I have documented how to configure xterm to do this,
             in the man page.

03/12/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             gl_get_line() by default now prints any 8-bit printable
             characters that don't match keybindings. Previously
             characters > 127 were only printed if preceded by the
             literal-next action.  Alternatively, by placing the
             command literal_if_printable in the tecla configuration
             file, all printable characters are treated as literal
             characters, even if they are bound to action functions.

             For international users of programs written by
             programmers that weren't aware of the need to call
             setlocale() to support alternate character sets, the
             configuration file can now also contain the single-word
             command "setlocale", which tells gl_get_line() to remedy
             this.

27/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           demo.c demo2.c enhance man3/gl_get_line.3
             All demos and programs now call setlocale(LC_CTYPE,"").
             This makes them support character sets of different
             locales, where specified with the LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL, or
             LANG environment variables. I also added this to the demo
             in the man page, and documented its effect.

27/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c
             When displaying unsigned characters with values over
             127 literally, previously it was assumed that they would
             all be displayable. Now isprint() is consulted, and if it
             says that a character isn't printable, the character code
             is displayed in octal like \307. In non-C locales, some
             characters with values > 127 are displayable, and
             isprint() tells gl_get_line() which are and which aren't.

27/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c pathutil.c history.c enhance.c demo2.c
             All arguments of the ctype.h character class functions
             are now cast to (int)(unsigned char). Previously they
             were cast to (int), which doesn't correctly conform to
             the requirements of the C standard, and could cause
             problems for characters with values > 127 on systems
             with signed char's.

26/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           man3/enhance.3 man3/libtecla.3
             I started writing a man page for the enhance program.

26/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           Makefile.in Makefile.rules INSTALL
             It is now possible to specify whether the demos and other
             programs are to be built, by overriding the default
             values of the DEMOS, PROGRAMS and PROGRAMS_R variables.
             I have also documented the BINDIR variable and the
             install_bin makefile target.

22/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c libtecla.h libtecla.map man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_ignore_signal.3 man3/gl_trap_signal.3
             Signal handling has now been modified to be customizable.
             Signals that are trapped by default can be removed from
             the list of trapped signals, and signals that aren't
             currently trapped, can be added to the list. Applications
             can also specify the signal and terminal environments in
             which an application's signal handler is invoked, and
             what gl_get_line() does after the signal handler returns.

13/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             Added half-bright, reverse-video and blinking text to the
             available prompt formatting options.
           getline.c
             Removed ^O from the default VT100 sgr0 capability
             string.  Apparently it can cause problems with some
             terminal emulators, and we don't need it, since it turns
             off the alternative character set mode, which we don't
             use.
           getline.c
             gl_tigetstr() and gl_tgetstr() didn't guard against the
             error returns of tigetstr() and tgetstr() respectively.
             They now do.

11/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c libtecla.h libtecla.map man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_prompt_style.3
             Although the default remains to display the prompt string
             literally, the new gl_prompt_style() function can be used
             to enable text attribute formatting directives in prompt
             strings, such as underlining, bold font, and highlighting
             directives.

09/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           enhance.c Makefile.rules configure.in configure
             I added a new program to the distribution that allows one
             to run most third party programs with the tecla library
             providing command-line editing.

08/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           libtecla.h getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3 history.c history.h
             I added a max_lines argument to gl_show_history() and
             _glh_show_history(). This can optionally be used to
             set a limit on the number of history lines displayed.
           libtecla.h getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             I added a new function called gl_replace_prompt(). This
             can be used by gl_get_line() callback functions to
             request that a new prompt be use when they return.

06/11/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             I implemented, bound and documented the list-history
             action, used for listing historical lines of the current
             history group.
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3 man3/gl_echo_mode.3
             I wrote functions to specify and query whether subsequent
             lines will be visible as they are being typed.

28/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             For those cases where a terminal provides its own
             high-level terminal editing facilities, you can now
             specify an edit-mode argument of 'none'. This disables
             all tecla key bindings, and by using canonical terminal
             input mode instead of raw input mode, editing is left up
             to the terminal driver.

21/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           libtecla.h getline.c history.c history.h
           man3/gl_get_line.3 man3/gl_history_info.3
             I added the new gl_state_of_history(),
             gl_range_of_history() and gl_size_of_history()
             functions for querying information about the
             history list.
           history.c
             While testing the new gl_size_of_history()
             function, I noticed that when the history buffer
             wrapped, any location nodes of old lines between
             the most recent line and the end of the buffer
             weren't being removed. This could result in bogus
             entries appearing at the start of the history list.
             Now fixed.

20/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           libtecla.h getline.c history.c history.h
           man3/gl_get_line.3 man3/gl_lookup_history.3
             I added a function called gl_lookup_history(), that
             the application can use to lookup lines in the history
             list.
           libtecla.h getline.c history.c history.h man3/gl_get_line.3
             gl_show_history() now takes a format string argument
             to control how the line is displayed, and with what
             information. It also now provides the option of either
             displaying all history lines or just those of the
             current history group.
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             gl_get_line() only archives lines in the history buffer
             if the newline action was invoked by a newline or
             carriage return character.

16/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           history.c history.h getline.c libtecla.h libtecla.map
           man3/gl_get_line.3 man3/gl_resize_history.3
           man3/gl_limit_history.3 man3/gl_clear_history.3
           man3/gl_toggle_history.3
	     I added a number of miscellaneous history configuration
	     functions. You can now resize or delete the history
	     buffer, limit the number of lines that are allowed in the
	     buffer, clear either all history or just the history of
	     the current history group, and temporarily enable and
	     disable the history mechanism.

13/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             tputs_fp is now only declared if using termcap or
             terminfo.
           getline.c libtecla.map man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_terminal_size.3
             I added a public gl_terminal_size() function for
             updating and querying the current size of the terminal.
           update_version configure.in libtecla.h
             A user noted that on systems where the configure script
             couldn't be used, it was inconvenient to have the version
             number macros set by the configure script, so they are
             now specified in libtecla.h. To reduce the likelihood
             that the various files where the version number now
             appears might get out of sync, I have written the
             update_version script, which changes the version number
             in all of these files to a given value.

01/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c history.c history.h man3/gl_get_line.3
             I added a max_lines argument to gl_save_history(), to
             allow people to optionally place a ceiling on the number
             of history lines saved. Specifying this as -1 sets the
             ceiling to infinity.

01/10/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           configure.in configure
             Under digital unix, getline wouldn't compile with
             _POSIX_C_SOURCE set, due to type definitions needed by
             select being excluded by this flag. Defining the
             _OSF_SOURCE macro as well on this system, resolved this.

30/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c libtecla.h history.c history.h man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_group_history.3
             I implemented history streams. History streams
             effectively allow multiple history lists to be stored in
             a single history buffer. Lines in the buffer are tagged
             with the current stream identification number, and
             lookups only consider lines that are marked with the
             current stream identifier.
           getline.c libtecla.h history.c history.h man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/gl_show_history.3
             The new gl_show_history function displays the current
             history to a given stdio output stream.

29/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             Previously new_GetLine() installed a persistent signal
             handler to be sure to catch the SIGWINCH (terminal size
             change) signal between calls to gl_get_line(). This had
             the drawback that if multiple GetLine objects were
             created, only the first GetLine object used after the
             signal was received, would see the signal and adapt to
             the new terminal size. Instead of this, a signal handler
             for sigwinch is only installed while gl_get_line() is
             running, and just after installing this handler,
             gl_get_line() checks for terminal size changes that
             might have occurred while the signal handler wasn't
             installed.
           getline.c
             Dynamically allocated copies of capability strings looked
             up in the terminfo or termcap databases are now made, so
             that calls to setupterm() etc for one GetLine object
             don't get trashed when another GetLine object calls
             setupterm() etc. It is now safe to allocate and use
             multiple GetLine objects, albeit only within a single
             thread.
           
28/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           version.c Makefile.rules
             I added a function for querying the version number of
             the library.

26/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             I added the new gl_watch_fd() function, which allows
             applications to register callback functions to be invoked
             when activity is seen on arbitrary file descriptors while
             gl_get_line() is awaiting keyboard input from the user.

           keytab.c
             If a request is received to delete a non-existent
             binding, which happens to be an ambiguous prefix of other
             bindings no complaint is now generated about it being
             ambiguous.

23/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c history.c history.h man3/gl_get_line.3
           libtecla.map demo.c
             I added new public functions for saving and restoring the
             contents of the history list. The demo program now uses
             these functions to load and save history in ~/.demo_history.

23/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             On trying the demo for the first time on a KDE konsole
             terminal, I discovered that the default M-O binding
             to repeat history was hiding the arrow keys, which are
             M-OA etc. I have removed this binding. The M-o (ie the
             lower case version of this), is still bound.

18/09/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3 libtecla.map
             Automatic reading of ~/.teclarc is now postponed until
             the first call to gl_get_line(), to give the application
             the chance to specify alternative configuration sources
             with the new function gl_configure_getline(). The latter
             function allows configuration to be done with a string, a
             specified application-specific file, and/or a specified
             user-specific file. I also added a read-init-files action
             function, for re-reading the configuration files, if any.
             This is by default bound to ^X^R. This is all documented
             in gl_get_line.3.

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             It is now possible to bind actions to key-sequences
             that start with printable characters. Previously
             keysequences were required to start with meta or control
             characters. This is documented in gl_get_line.3.

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             A customized completion function can now arrange for
             gl_get_line() to return the current input line whenever a
             successful completion has been made. This is signalled by
             setting the last character of the optional continuation
             suffix to a newline character. This is documented in
             gl_get_line.3.

05/07/2001 Bug reported by Mike MacFaden, fixed by mcs

           configure.in
             There was a bug in the configure script that only
             revealed itself on systems without termcap but not
             terminfo (eg. NetBSD). I traced the bug back to a lack of
             sufficient quoting of multi-line m4 macro arguments in
             configure.in, and have now fixed this and recreated the
             configure script.

05/07/2001 Bug reported and patched by Mike MacFaden (patch modified
           by mcs to match original intentions).

           getline.c
             getline.c wouldn't compile when termcap was selected as
             the terminal information database. setupterm() was being
             passed a non-existent variable, in place of the term[]
             argument of gl_control_strings(). Also if
             gl_change_terminal() is called with term==NULL, "ansi"
             is now substituted.

02/07/2001 Version 1.3.3 released.

27/06/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c expand.c cplmatch.c
             Added checks to fprintf() statements that write to the
             terminal.
           getline.c
             Move the cursor to the end of the line before suspending,
             so that the cursor doesn't get left in the middle of the
             input line.
           Makefile.in
             On systems that don't support shared libraries, the
             distclean target of make deleted libtecla.h. This has
             now been fixed.
           getline.c
             gl_change_terminal() was being called by gl_change_editor(),
             with the unwanted side effect that raw terminal modes were
             stored as those to be restored later, if called by an
             action function. gl_change_terminal() was being called in
             this case to re-establish terminal-specific key bindings,
             so I have just split this part of the function out into
             a separate function for both gl_change_editor() and
             gl_change_terminal() to call.

12/06/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             Signal handling has been improved. Many more signals are
             now trapped, and instead of using a simple flag set by a
             signal handler, race conditions are avoided by blocking
             signals during most of the gl_get_line() code, and
             unblocking them via calls to sigsetjmp(), just before
             attempting to read each new character from the user.
             The matching use of siglongjmp() in the signal
             handlers ensures that signals are reblocked correctly
             before they are handled. In most cases, signals cause
             gl_get_line() to restore the terminal modes and signal
             handlers of the calling application, then resend the
             signal to the application. In the case of SIGINT, SIGHUP,
             SIGPIPE, and SIGQUIT, if the process still exists after
             the signals are resent, gl_get_line() immediately returns
             with appropriate values assigned to errno. If SIGTSTP,
             SIGTTIN or SIGTTOU signals are received, the process is
             suspended. If any other signal is received, and the
             process continues to exist after the signal is resent to
             the calling application, line input is resumed after the
             terminal is put back into raw mode, the gl_get_line()
             signal handling is restored, and the input line redrawn.
           man/gl_get_line(3)
             I added a SIGNAL HANDLING section to the gl_get_line()
             man page, describing the new signal handling features.

21/05/2001 Version 1.3.2 released.

21/05/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             When vi-replace-char was used to replace the character at
             the end of the line, it left the cursor one character to
             its right instead of on top of it. Now rememdied.
           getline.c
             When undoing, to properly emulate vi, the cursor is now
             left at the leftmost of the saved and current cursor
             positions.
           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             Implemented find-parenthesis (%), delete-to-paren (M-d%),
             vi-change-to-paren (M-c%), copy-to-paren (M-y%).
           cplfile.c pcache.c
             In three places I was comparing the last argument of
             strncmp() to zero instead of the return value of
             strncmp().

20/05/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             Implemented and documented the vi-repeat-change action,
             bound to the period key. This repeats the last action
             that modified the input line.

19/05/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           man3/gl_get_line.3
             I documented the new action functions and bindings
             provided by Tim Eliseo, plus the ring-bell action and
             the new "nobeep" configuration option.
           getline.c
             I modified gl_change_editor() to remove and reinstate the
             terminal settings as well as the default bindings, since
             these have editor-specific differences. I also modified
             it to not abort if a key-sequence can't be bound for some
             reason. This allows the new vi-mode and emacs-mode
             bindings to be used safely.
           getline.c
             When the line was re-displayed on receipt of a SIGWINCH
             signal, the result wasn't visible until the next
             character was typed, since a call to fflush() was needed.
             gl_redisplay_line() now calls gl_flush_output() to remedy
             this.

17/05/2001 mcs@astro.catlech.edu

           getline.c
             Under Linux, calling fflush(gl->output_fd) hangs if
             terminal output has been suspended with ^S. With the
             tecla library taking responsability for reading the stop
             and start characters this was a problem, because once
             hung in fflush(), the keyboard input loop wasn't entered,
             so the user couldn't type the start character to resume
             output.  To remedy this, I now have the terminal process
             these characters, rather than the library.

12/05/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             The literal-next action is now implemented as a single
             function which reads the next character itself.
             Previously it just set a flag which effected the
             interpretation of the next character read by the input
             loop.
           getline.c
             Added a ring-bell action function. This is currently
             unbound to any key by default, but it is used internally,
             and can be used by users that want to disable any of the
             default key-bindings.

12/05/2001 Tim Eliseo    (logged here by mcs)

           getline.c
             Don't reset gl->number until after calling an action
             function. By looking at whether gl->number is <0 or
             not, action functions can then tell whether the count
             that they were passed was explicitly specified by the
             user, as opposed to being defaulted to 1.
           getline.c
             In vi, the position at which input mode is entered
             acts as a barrier to backward motion for the few
             backward moving actions that are enabled in input mode.
             Tim added this barrier to getline.
           getline.c
             In gl_get_line() after reading an input line, or
             having the read aborted by a signal, the sig_atomic_t
             gl_pending_signal was being compared to zero instead
             of -1 to see if no signals had been received.
             gl_get_line() will thus have been calling raise(-1),
             which luckily didn't seem to do anything. Tim also
             arranged for errno to be set to EINTR when a signal
             aborts gl_get_line().
           getline.c
             The test in gl_add_char_to_line() for detecting
             when overwriting a character with a wider character,
             had a < where it needed a >. Overwriting with a wider
             character thus overwrote trailing characters. Tim also
             removed a redundant copy of the character into the
             line buffer.
           getline.c
             gl_cursor_left() and gl->cursor_right() were executing
             a lot of redundant code, when the existing call to the
             recently added gl_place_cursor() function, does all that
             is necessary.
           getline.c
             Remove redundant code from backward_kill_line() by
             re-implimenting in terms of gl_place_cursor() and
             gl_delete_chars().
           getline.c
             gl_forward_delete_char() now records characters in cut
             buffer when in vi command mode.
           getline.c
             In vi mode gl_backward_delete_char() now only deletes
             up to the point at which input mode was entered. Also
             gl_delete_chars() restores from the undo buffer when
             deleting in vi insert mode.
           getline.c
             Added action functions, vi-delete-goto-column,
             vi-change-to-bol, vi-change-line, emacs-mode, vi-mode,
             vi-forward-change-find, vi-backward-change-find,
             vi-forward-change-to, vi-backward-change-to,
             vi-change-goto-col, forward-delete-find, backward-delete-find,
             forward-delete-to, backward-delete-to,
             delete-refind, delete-invert-refind, forward-copy-find,
             backward-copy-find, forward-copy-to, backward-copy-to
             copy-goto-column, copy-rest-of-line, copy-to-bol, copy-line,
             history-re-search-forward, history-re-search-backward.

           configure.in
             Old versions of GNU ld don't accept version scripts.
             Under Linux I thus added a test to try out ld with
             the --version-script argument to see if it works.
             If not, version scripts aren't used.
           configure.in
             My test for versions of Solaris earlier than 7
             failed when confronted by a three figure version
             number (2.5.1). Fixed.

30/04/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             In vi mode, history-search-backward and
             history-search-forward weren't doing anything when
             invoked at the start of an empty line, whereas
             they should have acted like up-history and down-history.
           Makefile.in Makefile.rules
             When shared libraries are being created, the build
             procedure now arranges for any alternate library
             links to be created as well, before linking the
             demos. Without this the demos always linked to the
             static libraries (which was perfectly ok, but wasn't a
             good example).
           Makefile.in Makefile.rules
             On systems on which shared libraries were being created,
             if there were no alternate list of names, make would
             abort due to a Bourne shell 'for' statement that didn't
             have any arguments. Currently there are no systems who's
             shared library configurations would trigger this
             problem.
           Makefile.rules
             The demos now relink to take account of changes to the
             library.
           configure.in configure
             When determining whether the reentrant version of the
             library should be compiled by default, the configure
             script now attempts to compile a dummy program that
             includes all of the appropriate system headers and
             defines _POSIX_C_SOURCE. This should now be a robust test
             on systems which use C macros to alias these function
             names to other internal functions.
           configure.in
             Under Solaris 2.6 and earlier, the curses library is in
             /usr/ccs/lib. Gcc wasn't finding this. In addition to
             remedying this, I had to remove "-z text" from
             LINK_SHARED under Solaris to get it to successfully
             compile the shared library against the static curses
             library.
           configure.in
             Under Linux the -soname directive was being used
             incorrectly, citing the fully qualified name of the
             library instead of its major version alias. This will
             unfortunately mean that binaries linked with the 1.2.3
             and 1.2.4 versions of the shared library won't use
             later versions of the library unless relinked.

30/04/2001 Version 1.3.0 released.

28/04/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           configure.in
             I removed the --no-undefined directive from the Linux
             LINK_SHARED command. After recent patches to our RedHat
             7.0 systems ld started reporting some internal symbols of
             libc as being undefined.  Using nm on libc indicated that
             the offending symbols are indeed defined, albeit as
             "common" symbols, so there appears to be a bug in
             RedHat's ld. Removing this flag allows the tecla shared
             library to compile, and programs appear to function fine.
           man3/gl_get_line.3
             The default key-sequence used to invoke the
             read-from-file action was incorrectly cited as ^Xi
             instead of ^X^F.

26/04/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c man3/gl_get_line.3
             A new vi-style editing mode was added. This involved
             adding many new action functions, adding support for
             specifying editing modes in users' ~/.teclarc files,
             writing a higher level cursor motion function to support
             the different line-end bounds required in vi command
             mode, and a few small changes to support the fact that vi
             has two modes, input mode and command mode with different
             bindings.

             When vi editing mode is enabled, any binding that starts
             with an escape or a meta character, is interpreted as a
             command-mode binding, and switches the library to vi
             command mode if not already in that mode. Once in command
             mode the first character of all keysequences entered
             until input mode is re-enabled, are quietly coerced to
             meta characters before being looked up in the key-binding
             table. So, for example, in the key-binding table, the
             standard vi command-mode 'w' key, which moves the cursor
             one word to the right, is represented by M-w. This
             emulates vi's dual sets of bindings in a natural way
             without needing large changes to the library, or new
             binding syntaxes. Since cursor keys normally emit
             keysequences which start with escape, it also does
             something sensible when a cursor key is pressed during
             input mode (unlike true vi, which gets upset).

             I also added a ^Xg binding for the new list-glob action
             to both the emacs and vi key-binding tables. This lists
             the files that match the wild-card expression that
             precedes it on the command line.

             The function that reads in ~/.teclarc used to tell
             new_GetLine() to abort if it encountered anything that it
             didn't understand in this file. It now just reports an
             error and continues onto the next line.
           Makefile.in:
             When passing LIBS=$(LIBS) to recursive invokations of
             make, quotes weren't included around the $(LIBS) part.
             This would cause problems if LIBS ever contained more
             than one word (with the supplied configure script this
             doesn't happen currently). I added these quotes.
           expand.c man3/ef_expand_file.3:
             I wrote a new public function called ef_list_expansions(),
             to list the matching filenames returned by
             ef_expand_file().

             I also fixed the example in the man page, which cited
             exp->file instead of exp->files, and changed the
             dangerous name 'exp' with 'expn'.
           keytab.c:
             Key-binding tables start with 100 elements, and are
             supposedly incremented in size by 100 elements whenever
             the a table runs out of space. The realloc arguments to
             do this were wrong. This would have caused problems if
             anybody added a lot of personal bindings in their
             ~/.teclarc file. I only noticed it because the number of
             key bindings needed by the new vi mode exceeded this
             number.
           libtecla.map
             ef_expand_file() is now reported as having been added in
             the upcoming 1.3.0 release.

             To allow the library to be compiled with a C++ compiler,
             without generating warnings, a few casts were added where
             void* return values were being assigned directly to
             none void* pointer variables.

           libtecla.map:
             Added comment header to explain the purpose of the file.
             Also added cpl_init_FileArgs to the list of exported
             symbols. This symbol is deprecated, and no longer
             documented, but for backwards compatibility, it should
             still be exported.
           configure:
             I had forgotten to run autoconf before releasing version
             1.2.4, so I have just belatedly done so.  This enables
             Markus' changes to "configure.in" documented previously,
             (see 17/03/2001).

           libtecla.h
             A couple of the function prototypes in libtecla.h have
             (FILE *) argument declarations, which means that stdio.h
             needs to be included. The header file should be self
             contained, so libtecla.h now includes stdio.h.

18/03/2001 Version 1.2.4 released.

           README html/index.html configure.in
             Incremented minor version from 3 to 4.

           getline.c
             The fix for the end-of-line problem that I released a
             couple of weeks ago, only worked for the first line,
             because I was handling this case when the cursor position
             was equal to the last column, rather than when the cursor
             position modulo ncolumn was zero.
           Makefile.in Makefile.rules
             The demos are now made by default, their rules now being
             int Makefile.rules instead of Makefile.in.
           INSTALL
             I documented how to compile the library in a different
             directory than the distribution directory.
             I also documented features designed to facilitate
             configuring and building the library as part of another
             package.

17/03/2001 Markus Gyger (logged here by mcs)

           getline.c
             Until now cursor motions were done one at a time. Markus
             has added code to make use the of the terminfo capability
             that moves the cursor by more than one position at a
             time. This greatly improves performance when editing near
             the start of long lines.
           getline.c
             To further improve performance, Markus switched from
             writing one character at a time to the terminal, using
             the write() system call, to using C buffered output
             streams. The output buffer is only flushed when
             necessary.
           Makefile.rules Makefile.in configure.in
             Added support for compiling for different architectures
             in different directories. Simply create another directory
             and run the configure script located in the original
             directory.
           Makefile.in configure.in libtecla.map
             Under Solaris, Linux and HP-UX, symbols that are to be
             exported by tecla shared libraries are explicitly specified
             via symbol map files. Only publicly documented functions
             are thus visible to applications.
           configure.in
             When linking shared libraries under Solaris SPARC,
             registers that are reserved for applications are marked
             as off limits to the library, using -xregs=no%appl when
             compiling with Sun cc, or -mno-app-regs when compiling
             with gcc. Also removed -z redlocsym for Solaris, which
             caused problems under some releases of ld.
           homedir.c  (after minor changes by mcs)
             Under ksh, ~+ expands to the current value of the ksh
             PWD environment variable, which contains the path of
             the current working directory, including any symbolic
             links that were traversed to get there. The special
             username "+" is now treated equally by tecla, except
             that it substitutes the return value of getcwd() if PWD
             either isn't set, or if it points at a different
             directory than that reported by getcwd().

08/03/2001 Version 1.2.3 released.

08/03/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             On compiling the library under HP-UX for the first time
             I encountered and fixed a couple of bugs:

             1. On all systems except Solaris, the callback function
                required by tputs() takes an int argument for the
                character that is to be printed. Under Solaris it
                takes a char argument. The callback function was
                passing this argument, regardless of type, to write(),
                which wrote the first byte of the argument.  This was
                fine under Solaris and under little-endian systems,
                because the first byte contained the character to be
                written, but on big-endian systems, it always wrote
                the zero byte at the other end of the word. As a
                result, no control characters were being written to
                the terminal.
             2. While attempting to start a newline after the user hit
                enter, the library was outputting the control sequence
                for moving the cursor down, instead of the newline
                character. On many systems the control sequence for
                moving the cursor down happends to be a newline
                character, but under HP-UX it isn't. The result was
                that no new line was being started under HP-UX.

           configure.in Makefile.in Makefile.stub configure config.guess
           config.sub Makefile.rules install-sh PORTING README INSTALL
             Configuration and compilation of the library is now
             performed with the help of an autoconf configure
             script. In addition to relieving the user of the need to
             edit the Makefile, this also allows automatic compilation
             of the reentrant version of the library on platforms that
             can handle it, along with the creation of shared
             libraries where configured. On systems that aren't known
             to the configure script, just the static tecla library is
             compiled. This is currently the case on all systems
             except Linux, Solaris and HP-UX. In the hope that
             installers will provide specific conigurations for other
             systems, the configure.in script is heavily commented,
             and instructions on how to use are included in a new
             PORTING file.

24/02/2001 Version 1.2b released.

22/02/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             It turns out that most terminals, but not all, on writing
             a character in the rightmost column, don't wrap the
             cursor onto the next line until the next character is
             output. This library wasn't aware of this and thus if one
             tried to reposition the cursor from the last column,
             gl_get_line() thought that it was moving relative to a
             point on the next line, and thus moved the cursor up a
             line. The fix was to write one extra character when in
             the last column to force the cursor onto the next line,
             then backup the cursor to the start of the new line.
           getline.c
             On terminal initialization, the dynamic LINES and COLUMNS
             environment variables were ignored unless
             terminfo/termcap didn't return sensible dimensions. In
             practice, when present they should override the static
             versions in the terminfo/termcap databases. This is the
             new behavior. In reality this probably won't have caused
             many problems, because a SIGWINCH signal which informs of
             terminal size changes is sent when the terminal is
             opened, so the dimensions established during
             initialization quickly get updated on most systems.

18/02/2001 Version 1.2a released.

18/02/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             Three months ago I moved the point at which termios.h
             was included in getline.c. Unfortunately, I didn't notice
             that this moved it to after the test for TIOCGWINSZ being
             defined. This resulted in SIGWINCH signals not being
             trapped for, and thus terminal size changes went
             unnoticed. I have now moved the test to after the 
             inclusion of termios.h.

12/02/2001 Markus Gyger     (described here by mcs)

           man3/pca_lookup_file.3 man3/gl_get_line.3
           man3/ef_expand_file.3 man3/cpl_complete_word.3
             In the 1.2 release of the library, all functions in the
             library were given man pages. Most of these simply
             include one of the above 4 man pages, which describe the
             functions while describing the modules that they are in.
             Markus added all of these function names to the lists in
             the "NAME" headers of the respective man pages.
             Previously only the primary function of each module was
             named there.

11/02/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             On entering a line that wrapped over two or more
             terminal, if the user pressed enter when the cursor
             wasn't on the last of the wrapped lines, the text of the
             wrapped lines that followed it got mixed up with the next
             line written by the application, or the next input
             line. Somehow this slipped through the cracks and wasn't
             noticed until now. Anyway, it is fixed now.

09/02/2001 Version 1.2 released.

04/02/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           pcache.c libtecla.h
             With all filesystems local, demo2 was very fast to start
             up, but on a Sun system with one of the target
             directories being on a remote nfs mounted filesystem, the
             startup time was many seconds. This was due to the
             executable selection callback being applied to all files
             in the path at startup. To avoid this, all files are now
             included in the cache, and the application specified
             file-selection callback is only called on files as they
             are matched. Whether the callback rejected or accepted
             them is then cached so that the next time an already
             checked file is looked at, the callback doesn't have to
             be called. As a result, startup is now fast on all
             systems, and since usually there are only a few matching
             file completions at a time, the delay during completion
             is also usually small. The only exception is if the user
             tries to complete an empty string, at which point all
             files have to be checked. Having done this once, however,
             doing it again is fast.
           man3/pca_lookup_file.3
             I added a man page documenting the new PathCache module.
           man3/<many-new-files>.3
             I have added man pages for all of the functions in each
             of the modules. These 1-line pages use the .so directive
             to redirect nroff to the man page of the parent module.
           man Makefile update_html
             I renamed man to man3 to make it easier to test man page
             rediction, and updated Makefile and update_html
             accordingly. I also instructed update_html to ignore
             1-line man pages when making html equivalents of the man
             pages.
           cplmatch.c
             In cpl_list_completions() the size_t return value of
             strlen() was being used as the length argument of a "%*s"
             printf directive. This ought to be an int, so the return
             value of strlen() is now cast to int. This would have
             caused problems on architectures where the size of a
             size_t is not equal to the size of an int.

02/02/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             Under UNIX, certain terminal bindings are set using the
             stty command. This, for example, specifies which control
             key generates a user-interrupt (usually ^C or ^Y). What I
             hadn't realized was that ASCII NUL is used as the way to
             specify that one of these bindings is unset. I have now
             modified the code to skip unset bindings, leaving the
             corresponding action bound to the built-in default, or a
             user provided binding.

28/01/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           pcache.c libtecla.h
             A new module was added which supports searching for files
             in any colon separated list of directories, such as the
             unix execution PATH environment variable. Files in these
             directories, after being individually okayed for
             inclusion via an application provided callback, are
             cached in a PathCache object. You can then look up the
             full pathname of a given filename, or you can use the
             provided completion callback to list possible completions
             in the path-list. The contents of relative directories,
             such as ".", obviously can't be cached, so these
             directories are read on the fly during lookups and
             completions. The obvious application of this facility is
             to provide Tab-completion of commands, and thus a
             callback to place executable files in the cache, is
             provided.
           demo2.c
             This new program demonstrates the new PathCache
             module. It reads and processes lines of input until the
             word 'exit' is entered, or C-d is pressed. The default
             tab-completion callback is replaced with one which at the
             start of a line, looks up completions of commands in the
             user's execution path, and when invoked in other parts of
             the line, reverts to normal filename completion. Whenever
             a new line is entered, it extracts the first word on the
             line, looks it up in the user's execution path to see if
             it corresponds to a known command file, and if so,
             displays the full pathname of the file, along with the
             remaining arguments.
           cplfile.c
             I added an optional pair of callback function/data
             members to the new cpl_file_completions() configuration
             structure. Where provided, this callback is asked
             on a file-by-file basis, which files should be included
             in the list of file completions. For example, a callback
             is provided for listing only completions of executable
             files.
           cplmatch.c
             When listing completions, the length of the type suffix
             of each completion wasn't being taken into account
             correctly when computing the column widths. Thus the
             listing appeared ragged sometimes. This is now fixed.
           pathutil.c
             I added a function for prepending a string to a path,
             and another for testing whether a pathname referred to
             an executable file.

28/01/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           libtecla.h cplmatch.c man/cpl_complete_word.3
             The use of a publically defined structure to configure
             the cpl_file_completions() callback was flawed, so a new
             approach has been designed, and the old method, albeit
             still supported, is no longer documented in the man
             pages. The definition of the CplFileArgs structure in
             libtecla.h is now accompanied by comments warning people
             not to modify it, since modifications could break
             applications linked to shared versions of the tecla
             library. The new method involves an opaque CplFileConf
             object, instances of which are returned by a provided
             constructor function, configured with provided accessor
             functions, and when no longer needed, deleted with a
             provided destructor function. This is documented in the
             cpl_complete_word man page. The cpl_file_completions()
             callback distinguishes what type of configuration
             structure it has been sent by virtue of a code placed at
             the beginning of the CplFileConf argument by its
             constructor.

04/01/2001 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1j)

           getline.c
             I added upper-case bindings for the default meta-letter
             keysequences such as M-b. They thus continue to work
             when the user has caps-lock on.
           Makefile
             I re-implemented the "install" target in terms of new
             install_lib, install_inc and install_man targets. When
             distributing the library with other packages, these new
             targets allows for finer grained control of the
             installation process.

30/12/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c man/gl_get_line.3
             I realized that the recall-history action that I
             implemented wasn't what Markus had asked me for. What he
             actually wanted was for down-history to continue going
             forwards through a previous history recall session if no
             history recall session had been started while entering
             the current line. I have thus removed the recall-history
             action and modified the down-history action function
             accordingly.

24/12/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c
             I modified gl_get_line() to allow the previously returned
             line to be passed in the start_line argument.
           getline.c man/gl_get_line.3
             I added a recall-history action function, bound to M^P.
             This recalls the last recalled history line, regardless
             of whether it was from the current or previous line.

13/12/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1i)

           getline.c history.h history.c man/gl_get_line.3
             I implemented the equivalent of the ksh Operate action. I
             have named the tecla equivalent "repeat-history". This
             causes the line that is to be edited to returned, and
             arranges for the next most recent history line to be
             preloaded on the next call to gl_get_line(). Repeated
             invocations of this action thus result in successive
             history lines being repeated - hence the
             name. Implementing the ksh Operate action was suggested
             by Markus Gyger. In ksh it is bound to ^O, but since ^O
             is traditionally bound by the default terminal settings,
             to stop-output, I have bound the tecla equivalent to M-o.

01/12/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1h)

           getline.c keytab.c keytab.h man/gl_get_line.3
             I added a digit-argument action, to allow repeat
             counts for actions to be entered. As in both tcsh
             and readline, this is bound by default to each of
             M-0, M-1 through to M-9, the number being appended
             to the current repeat count. Once one of these has been
             pressed, the subsequent digits of the repeat count can be
             typed with or without the meta key pressed. It is also
             possible to bind digit-argument to other keys, with or
             without a numeric final keystroke. See man page for
             details.

           getline.c man/gl_get_line.3
             Markus noted that my choice of M-< for the default
             binding of read-from-file, could be confusing, since
             readline binds this to beginning-of-history. I have
             thus rebound it to ^X^F (ie. like find-file in emacs).

           getline.c history.c history.h man/gl_get_line.3
             I have now implemented equivalents of the readline
             beginning-of-history and end-of-history actions.
             These are bound to M-< and M-> respectively.

           history.c history.h
             I Moved the definition of the GlHistory type, and
             its subordinate types from history.h to history.c.
             There is no good reason for any other module to
             have access to the innards of this structure.

27/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1g)

           getline.c man/gl_get_line.3
             I added a "read-from-file" action function and bound it
             by default to M-<. This causes gl_get_line() to
             temporarily return input from the file who's name
             precedes the cursor.
             
26/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           getline.c keytab.c keytab.h man/gl_get_line.3
             I have reworked some of the keybinding code again.

             Now, within key binding strings, in addition to the
             previously existing notation, you can now use M-a to
             denote meta-a, and C-a to denote control-a. For example,
             a key binding which triggers when the user presses the
             meta key, the control key and the letter [
             simultaneously, can now be denoted by M-C-[, or M-^[ or
             \EC-[ or \E^[.

             I also updated the man page to use M- instead of \E in
             the list of default bindings, since this looks cleaner.

           getline.c man/gl_get_line.3
             I added a copy-region-as-kill action function and
             gave it a default binding to M-w.

22/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu

           *.c
             Markus Gyger sent me a copy of a previous version of
             the library, with const qualifiers added in appropriate
             places. I have done the same for the latest version.
             Among other things, this gets rid of the warnings
             that are generated if one tells the compiler to
             const qualify literal strings.

           getline.c getline.h glconf.c
             I have moved the contents of glconf.c and the declaration
             of the GetLine structure into getline.c. This is cleaner,
             since now only functions in getline.c can mess with the
             innards of GetLine objects. It also clears up some problems
             with system header inclusion order under Solaris, and also
             the possibility that this might result in inconsistent
             system macro definitions, which in turn could cause different
             declarations of the structure to be seen in different files.

           hash.c
             I wrote a wrapper function to go around strcmp(), such that
             when hash.c is compiled with a C++ compiler, the pointer
             to the wrapper function is a C++ function pointer.
             This makes it compatible with comparison function pointer
             recorded in the hash table.

           cplmatch.c getline.c libtecla.h
             Markus noted that the Sun C++ compiler wasn't able to
             match up the declaration of cpl_complete_word() in
             libtecla.h, where it is surrounded by a extern "C" {}
             wrapper, with the definition of this function in
             cplmatch.c. My suspicion is that the compiler looks not
             only at the function name, but also at the function
             arguments to see if two functions match, and that the
             match_fn() argument, being a fully blown function pointer
             declaration, got interpetted as that of a C function in
             one case, and a C++ function in the other, thus
             preventing a match.

             To fix this I now define a CplMatchFn typedef in libtecla.h,
             and use this to declare the match_fn callback.

20/11/2000 (Changes suggested by Markus Gyger to support C++ compilers):
           expand.c
             Renamed a variable called "explicit" to "xplicit", to
             avoid conflicts when compiling with C++ compilers.
           *.c
             Added explicit casts when converting from (void *) to
             other pointer types. This isn't needed in C but it is
             in C++.
           getline.c
             tputs() has a strange declaration under Solaris. I was
             enabling this declaration when the SPARC feature-test
             macro was set. Markus changed the test to hinge on the
             __sun and __SVR4 macros.
           direader.c glconf.c stringrp.c
             I had omitted to include string.h in these two files.

           Markus also suggested some other changes, which are still
           under discussion. With the just above changes however, the
           library compiles without complaint using g++.

19/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu
           getline.h getline.c keytab.c keytab.h glconf.c
           man/gl_get_line.3
             I added support for backslash escapes (include \e
             for the keyboard escape key) and literal binary
             characters to the characters allowed within key sequences
             of key bindings.

           getline.h getline.c keytab.c keytab.h glconf.c
           man/gl_get_line.3
             I introduced symbolic names for the arrow keys, and
             modified the library to use the cursor key sequences
             reported by terminfo/termcap in addition to the default
             ANSI ones. Anything bound to the symbolically named arrow
             keys also gets bound to the default and terminfo/termcap
             cursor key sequences. Note that under Solaris
             terminfo/termcap report the properties of hardware X
             terminals when TERM is xterm instead of the terminal
             emulator properties, and the cursor keys on these two
             systems generate different key sequences. This is an
             example of why extra default sequences are needed.

           getline.h getline.c keytab.c
             For some reason I was using \e to represent the escape
             character. This is supported by gcc, which thus doesn't
             emit a warning except with the -pedantic flag, but isn't
             part of standard C. I now use a macro to define escape
             as \033 in getline.h, and this is now used wherever the
             escape character is needed.

17/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1d)

           getline.c, man/gl_get_line(3), html/gl_get_line.html
             In tcsh ^D is bound to a function which does different
             things depending on where the cursor is within the input
             line. I have implemented its equivalent in the tecla
             library. When invoked at the end of the line this action
             function displays possible completions. When invoked on
             an empty line it causes gl_get_line() to return NULL,
             thus signalling end of input. When invoked within a line
             it invokes forward-delete-char, as before. The new action
             function is called del-char-or-list-or-eof.

           getline.c, man/gl_get_line(3), html/gl_get_line.html
             I found that the complete-word and expand-file actions
             had underscores in their names instead of hyphens. This
             made them different from all other action functions, so I
             have changed the underscores to hyphens.

           homedir.c
             On SCO UnixWare while getpwuid_r() is available, the
             associated _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX macro used by sysconf()
             to find out how big to make the buffer to pass to this
             function to cater for any password entry, doesn't
             exist. I also hadn't catered for the case where sysconf()
             reports that this limit is indeterminate. I have thus
             change the code to substitute a default limit of 1024 if
             either the above macro isn't defined or if sysconf() says
             that the associated limit is indeterminate.
           
17/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1c)

           getline.c, getline.h, history.c, history.h
             I have modified the way that the history recall functions
             operate, to make them better emulate the behavior of
             tcsh. Previously the history search bindings always
             searched for the prefix that preceded the cursor, then
             left the cursor at the same point in the line, so that a
             following search would search using the same prefix. This
             isn't how tcsh operates. On finding a matching line, tcsh
             puts the cursor at the end of the line, but arranges for
             the followup search to continue with the same prefix,
             unless the user does any cursor motion or character
             insertion operations in between, in which case it changes
             the search prefix to the new set of characters that are
             before the cursor. There are other complications as well,
             which I have attempted to emulate. As far as I can
             tell, the tecla history recall facilities now fully
             emulate those of tcsh.

16/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1b)

           demo.c:
             One can now quit from the demo by typing exit.

           keytab.c:
             The first entry of the table was getting deleted
             by _kt_clear_bindings() regardless of the source
             of the binding. This deleted the up-arrow binding.
             Symptoms noted by gazelle@yin.interaccess.com.

           getline.h:
             Depending on which system include files were include
             before the inclusion of getline.h, SIGWINCH and
             TIOCGWINSZ might or might not be defined. This resulted
             in different definitions of the GetLine object in
             different files, and thus some very strange bugs! I have
             now added #includes for the necessary system header files
             in getline.h itself. The symptom was that on creating a
             ~/.teclarc file, the demo program complained of a NULL
             argument to kt_set_keybinding() for the first line of the
             file.

15/11/2000 mcs@astro.caltech.edu (Release of version 1.1a)

           demo.c:
             I had neglected to check the return value of
             new_GetLine() in the demo program. Oops.

           getline.c libtecla.h:
             I wrote gl_change_terminal(). This allows one to change to
             a different terminal or I/O stream, by specifying the
             stdio streams to use for input and output, along with the
             type of terminal that they are connected to.

           getline.c libtecla.h:
             Renamed GetLine::isterm to GetLine::is_term. Standard
             C reserves names that start with "is" followed by
             alphanumeric characters, so this avoids potential
             clashes in the future.

           keytab.c keytab.h
             Each key-sequence can now have different binding
             functions from different sources, with the user provided
             binding having the highest precedence, followed by the
             default binding, followed by any terminal specific
             binding. This allows gl_change_terminal() to redefine the
             terminal-specific bindings each time that
             gl_change_terminal() is called, without overwriting the
             user specified or default bindings. In the future, it will
             also allow for reconfiguration of user specified
             bindings after the call to new_GetLine(). Ie. deleting a
             user specified binding should reinstate any default or
             terminal specific binding.

           man/gl_get_line.3       html/gl_get_line.html
             I added sections on thread safety to the man pages of the
             individual modules.

           man/gl_get_line.3       html/gl_get_line.html
             I documented the new gl_change_terminal() function.

           man/gl_get_line.3       html/gl_get_line.html
             In the description of the ~/.teclarc configuration file,
             I had omitted the 'bind' command word in the example
             entry. I have now remedied this.
