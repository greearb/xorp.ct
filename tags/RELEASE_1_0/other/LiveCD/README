XORP Live CD Creation Toolkit
=============================

This LiveCD creation toolkit is based on the FreeBSD LiveCD toolkit by
the Brazilian FreeBSD Users Group.  Their original README files can be
found in the original_docs directory.  The original toolkit has been
heavily modified to build a XORP router instead of a generic FreeBSD
system.  Much of the flexibility of the original toolkit has been
deliverately removed as the goals of a router are rather different
from those of a generic host.


Objective
=========

The XORP LiveCD Toolkit has the objective of allowing the generation of 
bootable XORP CDs based on the FreeBSD operating system. 

The goals of the LiveCD are to allow users to experiment with XORP
without having to go through the process of installing FreeBSD or
Linux and compiling and installing XORP.  A system running off a
LiveCD also makes a great educational tool, and could even be used for
production use.


What is it?
==========

The XORP LiveCD Toolkit itself is a set of scripts that will prepare
an ISO image of a working FreeBSD system and the XORP routing
components, based on some questions asked to the user. A custom made
kernel will allow this ISO to be bootable.  Access to the hard disks
on the system the CD is running on has been disabled, so it's hard for
the resulting Live CD to harm any pre-installed operating systems on
the local disk.

The XORP router components needs to have somewhere to save config
files if the router configuration is to be preserved across reboots.
If the system has a floppy drive, XORP can use this to retain the
configuration files.  Otherwise XORP will come up with an empty
configuration every time it is booted.


Requirements
============

* To use the XORP LiveCD system:

- Run it as ROOT ! You must have write permission on several places.
- A working FreeBSD machine running version 4.9 or higher.  This
  probably does not work with FreeBSD 5.x.
- Your sources (/usr/src mandatory !) synchronized with the above version.
  The LiveCD will run do buildworld in /usr/src.
- Your XORP sources to build and install XORP.
- 2 GB of free disk space under /usr/local
- mkisofs

Of course you need a CD Recorder to burn the CD image, but it does not need 
to be in the FreeBSD system.

* To run the system based on a XORP LiveCD:

A computer with a fair amount of memory (at least 256MB), a CD-ROM
drive, optionally a floppy drive for saving configuration, and the
BIOS configured to boot from CD first (ahead of floppy and hard
drives).  The Live CD uses a uniprocessor kernel, so if your system
has additional processors, they will not be used.

How to use it
=============

Using the XORP LiveCD is very simple. It consists basically of one
scripts: LiveCD/livecd.sh

The livecd.sh script is the main tool, used to generate the ISO image.

Livecd.sh usage
===============

Before using the livecd.sh script you should edit the config file and set 
some basic variables in there. Those variables will define paths, places 
and files that will be used and/or generated during the operation. 
When  running the livecd.sh script those parameters will be displayed to 
you so that you can review them. To accept, press enter. To abort the 
process press Ctrl-C and change the file as needed.

There are 13 steps to create the LiveCD, and for each of those, there
is one entry on the main menu.  

 - The "install packages" step is optional, but can be used to add
   additional software to the LiveCD.
 - If you have already run buildworld, you can skip this step.
 - If you have already built XORP, you can skip this step.  
 - If you have already built a kernel from LiveCD, you can skip the
   buildkernel step.
 - The "burn CD" step is optional if you want to copy the ISO to
   another system to burn it.

The process can be interrupted at any time, and can be resumed by executing 
the next step right after the last concluded step.

Notes:
======

Due to the nature of a CDROM-based system, you system RAM is used
heavily. This means that if, for some reason your system's hardware is
not properly tuned or has bad quality memory, you may experience
several problems like core dumps (with signals 10 and 11), computer
freezing, etc. Most of the system will be running under MFS (memory
file system) therefore, bad memory behavior also means corrupted
files.
