KDOC -- C++ and IDL Source Documentation System
Version 2.0 ALPHA

KDOC creates cross-referenced documentation for C++ and CORBA IDL libraries
directly from the source. Documentation can be embedded in special doc
comments in the source.

Also included:

qt2kdoc:	Generates cross-reference index to link kdoc output with 
		Qt documentation.

makekdedoc:	Generates documentation for the KDE libraries.

KDOC 2.0 is still under development.

REQUIREMENTS

You need perl 5.6.0 or newer to run kdoc.



HOWTO

If you are running this straight from CVS, you will need to run 

	make -f Makefile.cvs

before building.

This should install kdoc:

./configure; make; make install
rehash; man kdoc



USING KDOC

The KDOC manual in docbook format is available in doc/kdoc.docbook.
This can be converted to various other online and print formats using
the jade and docbook packages.

Also, man pages are included for all utilities in this package. Best to
start with kdoc[1], and makekdedoc[1] if you wish to generate 
KDE Library API docs.
