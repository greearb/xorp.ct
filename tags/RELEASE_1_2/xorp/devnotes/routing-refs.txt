Below is a list of routing references that may be useful to the
XORP developers.

 * The Complete IS-IS Routing Protocol, Hannes Gredler and Walter Goralski,
   Springer, ISBN 1852338229.

     It not only describes the IS-IS itself, but describes also the
     Cisco IOS and Juniper JunOS IS-IS implementations.
     [See http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=158 for a longer review]

 * OSPF and IS-IS: Choosing an IGP for Large-Scale Networks,
   Jeff Doyle, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0321168798.

     This books compares OSPF and IS-IS, and includes examples for both
     Cisco IOS and Juniper JunOS.

 * Routing TCP/IP, Volume 1 (2nd Edition), Jeff Doyle and Jennifer Carroll,
   Cisco Press, ISBN 1587052024.
   Routing TCP/IP, Volume II (CCIE Professional Development), Jeff Doyle and
   Jennifer DeHaven Carroll, Cisco Press, ISBN 1578700892.

     From the configuration side they are Cisco specific but they
     give a good view into most routing protocols.
