Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing RIP Version 2.

RFC 1724                  RIP-2 MIB Extension              November 1994


1. The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
         describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      STD 16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism,
         which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
         the Internet suite of protocols.  STD 17/RFC 1213 defines MIB-
         II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience
         and new operational requirements.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
         network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2. Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

RFC 1724                  RIP-2 MIB Extension              November 1994


2.1 Format of Definitions

   Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9].

3. Overview

3.1 Textual Conventions

   Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention in this
   MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the readability of
   the specification and can ease comparison with other specifications
   if appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of the
   these textual conventions has no effect on either the syntax nor the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of these is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   one of these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
   define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP
   are necessary to accommodate these textual conventions which are
   adopted merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit
   of the elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   The new data type is RouteTag. The RouteTag type represents the
   contents of the Route Domain field in the packet header or route
   entry.

3.2 Structure of MIB

   The RIP-2 MIB contains global counters, useful for detecting the
   deleterious effects of RIP incompatibilities; two "interfaces"
   tables, which contains interface-specific statistics and
   configuration information; and an optional "peer" table, containing
   information that may be helpful in debugging neighbor relationships.
   Like the protocol itself, this MIB takes great care to preserve
   compatibility with RIP-1 systems and controls for monitoring and
   controlling system interactions.

3.3 Modifications from RFC 1389

   The RIP-2 MIB was originally published in RFC 1389.  It encoded the
   concept of a Routing Domain, and did not address unnumbered
   interfaces.

   In the current version of the protocol, Route Domains are deprecated;
   therefore, they are deprecated in the MIB as well.  This means that
   the object rip2IfConfDomain is deprecated, and the object
   rip2PeerDomain (which cannot be deprecated, being an instance object)



Malkin & Baker                                                  [Page 3]

RFC 1724                  RIP-2 MIB Extension              November 1994


   must always be zero.

   Unnumbered interfaces are supported in this version.  Since the IP
   Address that the neighbor uses may be unknown to the system, a
   pseudo-address is used to identify these interfaces.  The pseudo-
   address is in the class A network 0.0.0.0, and the host number (the
   least significant 24 bits of the address) are the ifIndex value of
   the relevant IP Interface.  This is an additional new meaning of the
   objects rip2IfStatAddress and rip2IfConfAddress, backward compatible
   with the RFC 1389 usage.  The object rip2IfConfSrcAddress is added,
   to permit the configuration of the source address on an unnumbered
   interface, and the meaning of the object rip2PeerAddress is broadened
   to remain relevant on unnumbered interfaces.

   rip2IfConfSend is augmented with two values for the use of Demand RIP
   under RIP-I and RIP-II rules.  This avoids the necessity of a Demand
   RIP MIB.

   MD5 Authentication is supported.
