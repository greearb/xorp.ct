====== BGP ======
===== BGP Terminology and Concepts =====

BGP is the Border Gateway Protocol, which is the principal inter-domain routing protocol in the Internet.
BGP version 4 is specified in RFC 4271, XORP BGP is compliant with the new RFC. Earlier versions of
BGP are now considered historic. XORP implements what is known as BGP4+. This is the core BGP-4
protocol, plus the multiprotocol extensions needed to route IPv6 traffic and to provide separate topology
information for multicast routing protocols to that used for unicast routing.
A complete description of BGP is outside the scope of this manual, but we will mention a few of the main
concepts.

==== Key BGP Concepts ====

The main concept used in BGP is that of the Autonomous System, or AS for short. An AS corresponds to
a routing domain that is under one administrative authority, and which implements its own routing policies.
BGP is used in two different ways:
   * EBGP is used to exchange routing information between routers that are in different ASes.
   * IBGP is used to exchange routing information between routers that are in the same AS. Typically these routes were originally learned from EBGP.

Each BGP route carries with it an AS Path, which essentially records the autonomous systems through which
the route has passed between the AS where the route was originally advertised and the current AS. When a
BGP router passes a route to a router in a neighboring AS, it prepends its own AS number to the AS path.
The AS path is used to prevent routes from looping, and also can be used in policy filters to decide whether
or not to accept a route.

When a route reaches a router over an EBGP connection, the router first decides if this is the best path to the
destination, based on a complex decision process and local policy configuration. If the route is the best path,
the route is passed on to all the other BGP routers in the same domain using IBGP connections, as well as
on to all the EBGP peers (as allowed by policy).

When a router receives a route from an IBGP peer, if the router decides this route is the best route to the
destination, then it will pass the route on to its EBGP peers, but it will not normally pass the route onto
another IBGP peer. This prevents routing information looping within the AS, but it means that by default
every BGP router in a domain must be peered with every other BGP router in the domain.
Of course such a full mesh of configured BGP peerings does not scale well to large domains, so two techniques can be used to improve scaling:
    * Confederations.
    * Route Reflectors.

BGP peerings are conducted over TCP connections which must be manually configured. A connection is an
IBGP peering if both routers are configured to be in the same AS; otherwise it is an EBGP peering.
Routers typically have multiple IP addresses, with at least one for each interface, and often an additional
routable IP address associated with the loopback interface1 . When configuring an IBGP connection, it is
good practice to set up the peering to be between the IP addresses on the loopback interfaces. This makes
the connection independent of the state of any particular interface. However, most EBGP peerings will be
configured using the IP address of the router that is directly connected to the EBGP peer router. Thus if the
interface to that peer goes down, the peering session will also go down, causing the routing to correctly fail
over to an alternative path.

===== Standards =====

XORP BGP complies with the following standards:

  * RFC 4271: A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4).
  * RFC 3392: Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4.
  * draft-ietf-idr-rfc2858bis-03.txt: Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4.
  * RFC 2545: Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6 Inter-Domain Routing.
  * RFC 1997: BGP Communities Attribute.
  * RFC 2796: BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh IBGP.
  * RFC 3065: Autonomous System Confederations for BGP.

===== Configuring BGP =====
==== Configuration Syntax ====

The configuration syntax for XORP BGP is given below.
<code>
protocols {
  bgp {
    targetname: text
    bgp-id: IPv4
    enable-4byte-as-numbers: bool
    local-as: int(1..65535)
    route-reflector text {
       cluster-id: IPv4
       disable: bool
    }
    confederation {
       identifier: int
       disable: bool
    }
    damping {
       half-life: int
       max-suppress: int
       reuse: int
       suppress: int
       disable: bool
    }
    peer text {
       local-ip: IPv4
       as: int(1..65535)
       next-hop: IPv4
       next-hop6: IPv6
       local-port: int(1..65535)
       peer-port: int(1..65535)
       holdtime: uint
       delay-open-time: uint
       client: bool
       confederation-member: bool
       prefix-limit {
         maximum: uint
         disable: bool
       }
       disable: bool
       ipv4-unicast: bool
       ipv4-multicast: bool
       ipv6-unicast: bool
       ipv6-multicast: bool
    }
}
</code>

The configuration parameters are used as follows:

^ Keyword ^ Description ^
^ protocols | This delimits the configuration for all routing protocols in the XORP router configuration. It is mandatory that BGP configuration is under the protocols node in the configuration. |
^ bgp | This delimits the BGP configuration part of the XORP router configuration. |
^ targetname | This is the name for this instance of BGP. It defaults to “bgp”, and it is not recommended that this default is overridden under normal usage scenarios. |
^ bgp-id | This is the BGP identifier for the BGP instance on this router. It is typically set to one of the router’s IP addresses, and it is normally required that this is globally unique. The required format of the BGP ID is a dotted-decimal IPv4 address, as mandated by the BGP specification. This is required even if the router only supports IPv6 forwarding. |
^ enable-4byte-as-numbers | By default AS numbers are 16-bit integers (0..65535). Enabling four-byte AS numbers (RFC 4893) allows BGP to negotiate the use of four-byte AS numbers with its peers.  This should only be enabled on a router if all the other routers in the same AS also enable it. Peers in other ASs do not need to support this, as BGP negotiates the representation with each peer and uses a backwards compatible format when it encounters an old peer. |
^ local-as | This is the autonomous system number for the AS in which this router resides. Any peers of this router must be configured to know this AS number - if there is a mismatch, a peering will not be established. By default, it is a 16-bit integer.  If four-byte AS numbers have been configured by setting enable-4byte-as-numbers, then the local AS number can be a four-byte AS number. The canonical form for four-byte AS numbers is x.y where x and y are both integers in the range 0..65535. |
^ route-reflector | This allows BGP to be configured as a Route Reflector. A peer can be configured as a client in the peer configuration. <code>
     cluster-id: All Route Reflectors in the same cluster should have the same four-byte cluster id.
         The required format is dotted-decimal IPv4 address.
     disable: This takes the value true or false. The default state is false, it allows Route
         Reflection to be disabled without removing the configuration. </code> |
^ confederation | This allows BGP to be configured as a confederation member. A peer can be configured as a confederation-member in the peer configuration. <code>
     identifier: The autonomous system number that the confederation is known by, by non
         confederation members.
     disable: This takes the value true or false. The default state is false, it allows confederations
         to be disabled without removing the configuration. </code> |
^ peer | This delimits the configuration of a BGP peering association with another router. Most BGP routers will have multiple peerings configured. The peer directive takes a parameter which is the peer identifier for the peer router. This peer identifier should normally be the IPv4 unicast address of the router we are peering with. The syntax allows it to be the domain names of the peer router for convenience, but this is not recommended in production settings.\\  For IBGP peerings the peer identifier will normally be an IP address bound to the router’s loopback address, so it is not associated with a specific interface, meaning that the peering will not go down if a single internal interface fails.\\  For EBGP peerings, the peer identifier will normally be the IP address of the peer router on the interface over which we wish to exchange traffic, so that if the interface goes down, the peering will drop.\\  For each configured peer, the following configuration options can be specified: <code>
      local-ip: This is the IP address of this router that we will use for BGP connections to this peer.
            It is mandatory to specify, and must be the same as the IP address configured on the peer router
            for this peering.
      as: this gives the AS number of this peer. This must match the AS number that the peer itself
            advertises to us, or the BGP peering will not be established. By default it is a 16-bit integer, and
            it is mandatory to specify.
            If four-byte AS numbers have been configured by setting enable-4byte-as-numbers,
            then the peer AS number can be a four byte AS number. The canonical form for four-byte AS
            numbers is x.y where x and y are both integers in the range 0..65535.
      next-hop: this is the IPv4 address that will be sent as the nexthop router address in routes that we
            send to this peer. Typically this is only specified for EBGP peerings.
      next-hop6: this is the IPv6 address that will be sent as the nexthop router address in routes that
            we send to this peer. Typically this is only specified for EBGP peerings.
      local-port: by default, BGP establishes its BGP connections over a TCP connection between
            port 179 on the local router and port 179 on the remote router. The local port for this peer-
            ing can be changed by modifying this attribute. This must be the same as the corresponding
            remote-port on the remote peer router or a connection will not be established.
      peer-port: The port for this peering on the remote router can be changed by modifying this
            attribute. See also: local-port.
      holdtime: This is the holdtime BGP should use when negotiating the connection with this peer.
            If no message is received from a BGP peer during the negotiated holdtime, the peering will be
            shut down.
      prefix-limit: A peering can be configured to be torn down if the maximum number of prefixes
            is exceeded.
      delay-open-time: This is a time in seconds to wait before sending an OPEN message, one the
            TCP session is established. This option is to allow the peer to send the first OPEN message. The
            default setting is zero.
      client: This takes the value true or false, it only has meaning if BGP is configured as a Route
            Reflector. If set to true the peer is a Route Reflector client.
      confederation-member: This takes the value true or false, it only has meaning if BGP is
            configured as a confederation member. If set to true the peer is a confederation member.
      disable: This takes the value true or false, and indicates whether the peering is currently dis-
            abled. This allows a peering to be taken down temporarily without removing the configuration 2 .
      ipv4-unicast: This takes the value true or false, and specifies whether BGP should negotiate
            multiprotocol support with this peer to allow IPv4 unicast routes to be exchanged. It is enabled
            by default.
      ipv4-multicast: This takes the value true or false, and specifies whether BGP should nego-
            tiate multiprotocol support with this peer to allow separate routes to be used for IPv4 unicast and
            IPv4 multicast. Normally this would only be enabled if PIM-SM multicast routing is running on
            the router.
      ipv6-unicast: This takes the value true or false, and specifies whether BGP should negotiate
            multiprotocol support with this peer to allow IPv6 unicast routes to be exchanged. </code> |
^ ipv6-multicast | This takes the value true or false, and specifies whether BGP should negotiate multiprotocol support with this peer to allow IPv6 multicast routes to be exchanged separately from IPv6 unicast routes. It is possible to enable IPv6 multicast support without enabling IPv6 unicast support. |

==== Example Configurations ====
<code>
protocols {
  bgp {
    bgp-id: 128.16.32.1
    local-as: 45678
    peer 192.168.150.1 {
      local-ip: 128.16.64.4
      as: 34567
      next-hop: 128.16.64.4
      holdtime: 120
      /* IPv4 unicast is enabled by default */
      ipv4-unicast: true
      /* Optionally enable other AFI/SAFI combinations */
      ipv4-multicast: true
      ipv6-unicast: true
      ipv6-multicast: true
    }
  }
}
</code>

This configuration is from a BGP router in AS 45678. The router has a BGP identifier of 128.16.32.1, which
will normally be one of the router’s IP addresses.

This router has only one BGP peering configured, with a peer on IP address 192.168.150.1. This peering
is an EBGP connection because the peer is in a different AS (34567). This router’s IP address used for this
peering is 128.16.64.4, and the router is also configured to set the next hop router field in routes it advertises
to the peer to be 128.16.64.4. Setting local-ip and next-hop to be the same is common for EBGP connections.
The holdtime for the peering is configured to be 120 seconds, but the precise value of the holdtime actually
used depends on negotiation with the peer. In addition to IPv4 unicast routing, which is enabled by default,
this peering is configured to allow the sending an receiving of IPv4 multicast routes and IPv6 unicast routes.

This router is also configured to originate routing advertisements for two subnets. These subnets might be
directly connected, or might be reachable via IGP routing.

The first advertisement this router originates is for subnet 128.16.16/24, reachable via both unicast and
multicast. The nexthop specified in 128.16.64.1, and this must be reachable via other routes in the routing
table, or this advertisement will not be made. If this router had any IBGP peerings, then the BGP route
advertised to those peers would indicate that 128.16.16/24 was reachable via next hop 128.16.64.1. However
in this case the only peering is an EBGP peering, and the next hop in all routes sent to that peer is set to
128.16.64.4 according to the nexthop directive for the peering.

The second advertisement is for an IPv6 route, configured to be usable only by IPv6 unicast traffic.

===== Monitoring BGP =====

On a router running BGP, the BGP routing state can be displayed using the show bgp operational-mode
command. Information is available about the status of BGP peerings and about the routes received and used.
In the 1.0 release, the set of commands is fairly limited, and will be increased in future releases to provide
better ways to display subsets of this information.

As always, command completion using <TAB> or ? will display the available sub-commands and parameters:
<code>
 user@hostname> show bgp ?
 Possible completions:
   peers                    Show BGP peers info
   routes                   Print BGP routes
   |                        Pipe through a command
</code>

The show bgp peers command will display information about the BGP peerings that have been configured. It supports the optional parameter detail to give a lot more information:
<code>
 user@hostname> show bgp peers ?
 Possible completions:
   <[Enter]>                Execute this command
   detail                   Show detailed BGP peers info
   |                        Pipe through a command
</code>

By itself, show bgp peers provides a short list of the peerings that are configured, irrespective of whether
the peering is in established state or not:
<code>
 user@hostname> show bgp peers
 Peer 1: local 192.150.187.112/179      remote 69.110.224.158/179
 Peer 2: local 192.150.187.112/179      remote 192.150.187.2/179
 Peer 3: local 192.150.187.112/179      remote 192.150.187.78/179
 Peer 4: local 192.150.187.112/179      remote 192.150.187.79/179
 Peer 5: local 192.150.187.112/179      remote 192.150.187.109/179
</code>

The command show bgp peers detail will give a large amount of information about all the peerings:
<code>
 user@hostname> show bgp peers detail
 Peer 1: local 192.150.187.112/179 remote 69.110.224.158/179
   Peer ID: none
   Peer State: ACTIVE
   Admin State: START
   Negotiated BGP Version: n/a
   Peer AS Number: 65014
   Updates Received: 0, Updates Sent: 0
   Messages Received: 0, Messages Sent: 0
   Time since last received update: n/a
   Number of transitions to ESTABLISHED: 0
   Time since last in ESTABLISHED state: n/a
   Retry Interval: 120 seconds
   Hold Time: n/a, Keep Alive Time: n/a
   Configured Hold Time: 120 seconds, Configured Keep Alive Time: 40 seconds
   Minimum AS Origination Interval: 0 seconds
   Minimum Route Advertisement Interval: 0 seconds
 Peer 2: local 192.150.187.112/179 remote 192.150.187.2/179
   Peer ID: 192.150.187.2
   Peer State: ESTABLISHED
   Admin State: START
   Negotiated BGP Version: 4
   Peer AS Number: 64999
   Updates Received: 52786, Updates Sent: 28
   Messages Received: 52949, Messages Sent: 189
   Time since last received update: 2 seconds
   Number of transitions to ESTABLISHED: 17
   Time since last entering ESTABLISHED state: 6478 seconds
   Retry Interval: 120 seconds
   Hold Time: 120 seconds, Keep Alive Time: 40 seconds
   Configured Hold Time: 120 seconds, Configured Keep Alive Time: 40 seconds
   Minimum AS Origination Interval: 0 seconds
   Minimum Route Advertisement Interval: 0 seconds
</code>

The most important piece of information is typically whether or not the peering is in ESTABLISHED state,
indicating that the peering is up and capable of exchanging routes. ACTIVE state means that the peering
is configured to be up on this router, but for some reason the peering is not currently up. Typically this is
because the remote peer is unreachable, or because no BGP instance is running on the remote peer.

The show bgp routes command displays the routes received by BGP from its peers. On a router with a
full BGP routing table (140000 routes as of July 2004) this command will produce a large amount of output:
<code>
 user@hostname> show bgp routes

</code>

The format of the output is one route per line. On each line:
   * A status code is displayed, showing whether the route is valid, and whether it was the best BGP route this router has received. A route is valid if the nexthop is reachable and it isn’t filtered by the inbound BGP filters.
   * The network prefix for which the route applies is listed in the form 4.17.226.0/23. This indicates the base address for the network (address 4.17.226.0), and the prefix length (23 bits). Thus this route applies for addresses 4.17.226.0 to 4.17.227.255 inclusive.
   * The nexthop is the IP address of the intermediate router towards which packet destined for the network prefix should be sent. In this example all the displayed routes have the same nexthop.
   * The peer is the IP address of the BGP router which sent us this route. The nexthop and the peer need not the the same (they often aren’t with IBGP peerings for example) but in all the routes in this example they are the same.
   * The AS path is listed next. This lists the AS numbers of the autonomous systems that the route has traversed to reach our router. The AS at the left end of the path is the one nearest to our router and the one at the right end of the path is usually the AS number of the route’s originator.
   * Finally, whether the route’s origin is from an IGP (i), from EGP (e, mostly obsolete), or incomplete (?) is listed.


===== BGP path selection =====

BGP can receive multiple paths to the same destination, there are a complicated set of rules to determine
which path should be used. At this time there are no configuration options that modify the behaviour of the
the path selection process, apart from policy that explicitly drops or modifies a path.

==== Reasons for ignoring a path ====

BGP requires that there is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) route to the NEXT HOP, if no route exists the
route is ignored. It is expected in release 1.5 that a switch will be available to toggle this requirement.

If the NEXT HOP in a path belongs to the router itself then the path is ignored.

==== BGP decision process ====

The BGP decision process is performed exactly as defined by RFC 4271.
