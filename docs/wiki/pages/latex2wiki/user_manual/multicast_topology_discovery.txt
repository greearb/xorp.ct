====== Multicast Topology Discovery ======

===== Terminology and Concepts =====

Multicast routing protocols such as PIM-SM (Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse-Mode) and PIM-DM
(Protocol Independent Multicast Dense-Mode) build the multicast delivery tree by using the RPF (Reverse-
Path Forwarding) information toward the root of the tree. The root could be the so-called Rendezvous Point
(RP) (in case of PIM-SM) or the source itself (in case of PIM-SM or PIM-DM).

The RPF information in each router is per multicast distribution tree and is basically the next-hop neighbor
router information toward the root of the tree. In other words, the RPF router is the next-hop router toward
the root. In case of PIM-SM, the RPF neighbor is typically the router that a Join message is sent to.

Obviously, all multicast routers must have consistent RPF state, otherwise a Join message may never reach
the root of the tree. Typically, the unicast path forwarding information is used to create the RPF information,
because under normal circumstances the unicast routing provides the necessary information to all routers.

Note that the unicast-based RPF creates multicast distribution trees where each branch of the tree follows the
unicast path from each leaf of the tree toward the root. Usually this is the desired behavior, but occasionally
someone may want the unicast and the multicast traffic to use different paths. For example, if a site has
two links to its network provider, one of the links may be used for unicast only, and the other one only for
multicast.

To provide for such flexibility in the configuration, the PIM-SM and PIM-DM specifications use the so called
Multicast Routing Information Base (MRIB) for obtaining the RPF information. Typically, the MRIB may
be derived from the unicast routing table, but some protocols such as MBGP may carry multicast-specific
topology information. Furthermore, the MRIB may be modified locally in each site by taking into account
local configuration and preferences. A secondary function of the MRIB is to provide routing metrics for
destination addresses. Those metrics are used by the PIM-SM and PIM-DM Assert mechanism.


===== Configuring the MRIB =====
The XORP RIB module contains a table with the MRIB. That table is propagated to the PIM-SM module
and is used by PIM-SM in the RPF computation. The MRIB table inside the RIB module is completely
independent from the Unicast Routing Information Base (URIB) table. The URIB table is created from
the unicast routes calculated by unicast routing protocols such as BGP, OSPF and RIP. The MRIB table is
created similarly, but only by those protocols that are explicitly configured to add their routes to the MRIB.
For example, if Multi-protocol BGP is enabled, then the BGP module will add multicast-specific routes to
the MRIB.

Currently, XORP supports the following methods for adding routing entries to the MRIB:

^  Method  ^  Description  ^
^  Multi-protocol BGP | The BGP module can be configured to negotiate multiprotocol support with its peers. Then, the BGP multicast routes will be installed in the MRIB. |
^  Static Routes | The Static Routes module can be used to configure static unicast and multicast routes. The unicast routes are added to the Unicast RIB, while the multicast routes are added to the MRIB. |
^  FIB2MRIB | If there are no unicast routing protocols configured in XORP to supply the MRIB routes, then the FIB2MRIB module can be used to populate the MRIB. If the FIB2MRIB module is enabled, it will register with the FEA to read the whole unicast forwarding table from the underlying system, and to receive notifications for all future modifications of that table. In other words, the FIB2MRIB task is to replicate the unicast forwarding information on that router into the MRIB. The FIB2MRIB module can be enabled by the following configuration statements: <code>
        protocols {
           fib2mrib {
              disable: false
           }
        }
</code> |

===== Monitoring the MRIB =====

All operational commands for monitoring MRIB begin with show route table. This section describes
those commands in details.

All RIB commands to view the RIB’s inner tables have the following form:
<code>
show route table {ipv4 | ipv6} {unicast | multicast} <protocol>
</code>

The commands to view the MRIB have the following form:
<code>
show route table {ipv4 | ipv6} multicast <protocol>
</code>

The value of <protocol> has to be one of the following:
^ Protocol ^ Description ^
^ ebgp | to show eBGP MBGP routes. |
^ fib2mrib | to show unicast routes for multicast extracted from kernel. |
^ final | to show MRIB winning routes. |
^ ibgp | to show iBGP MBGP routes. |
^ static | to show MRIB static routes. |

For example, the following command can be used to show the IPv4 FIB2MRIB routes:
<code>
 user@hostname> show route table ipv4 multicast fib2mrib
 10.2.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 0.0.0.0 via dc2/dc2
 10.3.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 0.0.0.0 via dc1/dc1
 10.4.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.3.0.2 via dc1/dc1
 10.5.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.2.0.4 via dc2/dc2
 10.6.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.2.0.1 via dc2/dc2
</code>

The final MRIB table can be shown with the following command:
<code>
 user@hostname> show route table ipv4 multicast final
 10.2.0.0/24      [connected(0)/0]
                  > to 0.0.0.0 via dc2/dc2
 10.3.0.0/24      [connected(0)/0]
                  > to 0.0.0.0 via dc1/dc1
 10.4.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.3.0.2 via dc1/dc1
 10.5.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.2.0.4 via dc2/dc2
 10.6.0.0/24      [fib2mrib(254)/65535]
                  > to 10.2.0.1 via dc2/dc2
