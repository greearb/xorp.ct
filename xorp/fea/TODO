* Check ioctl(SIOCGETTUNNEL) usage from Linux net-tools from USAGI's
  distribution (which returns "struct ip_tunnel_parm"),
  and ioctl(SIOCGETTUNNEL6) which returns "struct ip6_tunnel_parm".
  The source/destination addresses are in
  iptunnel.iph.saddr/iptunnel.iph.daddr
  and ip6tunnel.git_ip6h.ip6_src/ip6tunnel.git_ip6h.ip6_dst
  respectively.

  First, check whether the existing methods on Linux already
  take care of tunnels, and only if they don't then call the above
  two ioctls as appropriate.

* Check whether a returned MAC addresses of an interface is an
  Ethernet address before attempting to assign it as an Ethernet
  address.

* Sync by renaming all "IfTree& iftree" to "IfTree& it" (or vice-versa).

* Make sure that the interfaces in the interface tree are deleted properly
  whenever the underlying interfaces in the kernel change. E.g.,
  especially be careful in case an interface disappears, and immediately
  after that a new interface with different name but same interface index
  appears. In that case, we need to update properly the local cache
  that maps interface names to indexes.

* Parse and pass up Linux RTN_UNREACHABLE messages using the new resolve
  upcall mechanism.

==============================================================================
==== MFEA-specific TODO (mostly copied-in from the old stand-alone MFEA) =====

* The MFEA should call MRT_ADD_VIF on an interface only after a multicast
  routing protocol expresses interest in using that interface.

* The IPv4 raw packet input in case of OpenBSD has changed between versions.
  E.g., if (defined(__OpenBSD__) && (OpenBSD < 200311))
  then the processing should be same as FreeBSD and NetBSD.
  In other words, newer OpenBSD behaves differently.

* When start/stop multicast routing, call start_pim/stop_pim XRL as well.

* Implement following methods and their friends:
  - set_allow_kernel_signal_messages(bool v)

* Set the pif_index for MfeaVif.

* In MfeaDfe::is_valid(), the min threshold value must be defined
  somewhere else, and it should be consistent with
  BW_UPCALL_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_MIN_SEC and
  BW_UPCALL_THRESHOLD_INTERVAL_MIN_USEC

* Rename protocol_name and protocol_id in the send protocol messages
  to src_module_instance_name and src_module_id (or sth. like that).

* The min. required TTL to forward on a MFC entry should be configurable
  per vif.

* Rename "functions" with "methods" in classes inside *.hh
  (e.g., "Private functions". Same for all *.hh in other directories:
  mrt, cli, mld6igmp, pim, libproto.

* Use start_pim() and stop_pim() as appropriate.

* If a protocol deletes itself from the MFEA, make sure that the
  multicast leave operation will be performed for all groups it has joined.

* Fix all messages like the one below to print a more explicit information
  where the error happened. Apply same for CLI, MLD6IGMP, PIM:
    if (is_invalid_family) {
	// Invalid address family
	reason = c_format("Received protocol message with invalid "
			  "address family: IPv4");
	fail = true;
	return XrlCmdError::OKAY();
    }

* Wnen added a new protocol, schedule the sending back of the Vif
  info to happen AFTER the return of the XRL handler (???).
  If the registering protocol doesn't consider the return value
  from the registration before accepting any other info, then
  we don't need that. However, if the return value from the registration
  is important whether to start accepting info from the MFEA,
  then we must do the above.

* Some of the ProtoComm::_sndbuf0/1 or _rcvbuf0/1 are not used and/or
  should be much smaller.

* A single ProtoComm should be able to handle more than one protocol modules.

* 'int proto' (e.g. IPPROTO_IGMP, etc) should be renamed to 'proto_number'
   or somethinf like that.

* Use if_nametoindex(3) when available.

* Take care of scope_id for IPv6:
		struct sockaddr_in6 addr;
               if (IN6_IS_ADDR_LINKLOCAL(&addr.sin6_addr))
                {
                        addr.sin6_scope_id = if_nametoindex(ifa->ifa_name);
		}

* Make the behavior consistent: if we use ioctl() to get the list of
  interfaces, if there is an error, we return immediately;
  However, if we use sysctl method and if there is an error, we
  continue with the next interface.

* If closing the _mrouter_socket, make sure that _proto_socket for
  IGMP or ICMP6 is closed too (??).

* When sending a request using ProtoComm, make sure we are using the
  right socket (e.g., IOCTL, etc).

* In function headers, make sure that constants have % in front.
  E.g.: %XORP_OK %XORP_ERROR.

* Send email to KAME. In the mean time detect the problem in configure.in
#ifdef GET_TIME
#undef GET_TIME		// TODO: on FreeBSD-4.3 including both ip_mroute.h
			// and ip6_mroute.h is broken
#endif


* Change all "FOO node definition" to "FOO node declaration" (?)

* _max_rate_limit should be uint64_t, otherwise cannot create an
  explicit restriction to forward more than 4Gbps. However, the UNIX
  kernel uses u_int for that, so we don't have much choice.

==============================================================================
==== Packet ACL-specific TODO                                            =====

* Regression test for top half.
