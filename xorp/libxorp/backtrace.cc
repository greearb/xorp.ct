/**
 * Back-end implementation of runtime backtrace facility.
 *
 * @return pointer to an array of char* containing each backtrace line. The
 * storage must be freed with xorp_backtrace_free().
 *
 * XXX MUST be exception safe, apart from std::bad_alloc.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *  Currently it is implemented using the GLIBC-compatible backtrace()
 *  and backtrace_symbols() functions. On GLIBC systems, these are part
 *  of the libc library. On BSD systems, these are part of libexecinfo,
 *  a third-party implementation.
 *
 *  It is not guaranteed to produce correct results when the C/C++ runtime
 *  heap is corrupt, or when the stack is corrupt.
 *
 *  The output of backtrace() is an array of C strings containing
 *  function names and offsets. It will try to resolve the return addresses
 *  on the stack to symbols, using dladdr(), which is arch-independent.
 *  In some situations this might require building all executables with
 *  '-rdynamic', to get meaningful backtraces from stripped binaries.
 *
 *  It knows nothing about arguments or other stack frame entities.
 *  As most of the code here is C++, we need to post-process this output.
 *  This involves string processing, which in turn needs a working heap
 *  to store temporary allocations.
 *
 * FUTURE: This could be implemented using e.g. libunwind, libdwarf
 * to produce richer output (e.g. using separate symbol files
 * from the production shipping binaries, much like Microsoft's PDB format),
 * and this might insulate us from heap corruption.
 *
 * The approach taken really needs to be similar to that of a last-change
 * exception handler, to be useful in situations of catastrophic heap
 * corruption.
 *
 * XXX use of vector or array is a boost::scoped_array candidate.
 *     But we're in C and ABI land here, so stick to C.
 *     One malloc here is bad enough if the heap is toasted.
