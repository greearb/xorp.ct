/**
 * @short Make two route @ref RouteTables behave like one, while
 * resolving nexthops that are not immediate neighbors
 *
 * ExtIntTable takes two routing tables and combines them together to
 * form a single table, where routes for the same subnet with a lower
 * admin distance override those with a higher admin distance.  The
 * two parent tables are different: the Internal table takes routes
 * only from IGP protocols, and so the nexthops of routes it provides
 * are always immediate neighbors.  The External table takes routes
 * from EGP protocols, and so the nexthops of routes it provides may
 * not be immediate neighbors.  The ExtIntTable resolves the nexthops
 * of all routes it propagates downstream.  If a nexthop cannot be
 * resolved, it is not propagated downstream, but is stored pending
 * the arrival of a route that would permit the nexthop to be
 * resolved.
 *
 * An add_route request from a parent tables causes a lookup on the
 * other parent table.  If the route is better than the one from the
 * other table, or no route exists in the other table, then the new
 * route is passed downstream.
 *
 * An delete_route request from a parent table also causes a lookup on
 * the other parent table.  The delete_route is propagated downstream.
 * If an alternative route is found, then that is then propagated
 * downsteam as an add_route to replace the deleted route.
 *
 * Lookups from downsteam cause lookups on both parent tables.  The
 * better response is given.
 *
 * A RIB normally only has one ExtIntTable.
